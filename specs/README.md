## Purpose and Philosophy

These specifications ensure:
- **Consistency** across all AetherOS development efforts
- **Quality** through established standards and best practices
- **Scalability** by defining architectural principles
- **Security** by mandating secure development practices
- **Maintainability** through consistent code style and organization
- **Developer Velocity** through clear workflows and automated tooling

## Package Management Standards

AetherOS follows a hierarchical approach to package management:

### JavaScript/Node.js
1. **Primary:** Yarn (`yarn install`, `yarn add`)
2. **Fallback:** pnpm (`pnpm install`, `pnpm add`)
3. **Last Resort:** npm (`npm install`)

### Python (Future Services)
1. **Primary:** uv (`uv add`, `uv install`)
2. **Fallback:** Poetry (`poetry add`, `poetry install`)
3. **Last Resort:** pip (`pip install`)

**Rationale:** These tools provide better dependency resolution, faster installs, and more reliable lock files.

## Usage Guidelines

### For All Contributors
1. **Read and understand** these specifications before contributing
2. **Follow the guidelines** when writing code, documentation, or tests
3. **Reference these documents** during code reviews
4. **Propose updates** via pull requests when standards need evolution

### For New Team Members
1. **Start with** [`setup-guide.md`](setup-guide.md) for environment setup
2. **Review** [`standards/tech-stack.md`](standards/tech-stack.md) for technology choices
3. **Understand** [`standards/best-practices.md`](standards/best-practices.md) for development approach
4. **Follow** [`standards/code-style.md`](standards/code-style.md) for formatting standards

### For AI Development Assistants
These specifications are designed to work with AI coding assistants like Cursor, Claude Code, and GitHub Copilot:

1. **Context Loading:** Reference relevant specification files when starting new tasks
2. **Conditional Blocks:** Pay attention to conditional sections in best-practices.md
3. **Standards Compliance:** Ensure generated code follows established patterns
4. **Workflow Adherence:** Follow the structured workflows in the instructions directory

## Key Features of AetherOS Specifications

- Conditional context blocks for efficient AI assistant usage
- Clear separation of concerns between different types of standards

### 2. Technology Stack Clarity
- Explicit package manager preferences
- Clear rationale for technology choices
- Upgrade paths and alternatives documented

### 3. Comprehensive Code Style
- Language-specific style guides
- Automated enforcement through linting
- Examples and anti-patterns

### 4. Structured Workflows

## Development Workflow Integration

### Pre-Development
```bash
# 1. Review pre-flight checklist
open specs/instructions/meta/pre-flight.md

# 2. Set up development environment
# Follow specs/setup-guide.md

# 3. Understand the task requirements
# Use specs/instructions/core/create-spec.md for new features
```

### During Development
```bash
# 1. Follow task execution workflow
# Reference specs/instructions/core/execute-task.md

# 2. Ensure code quality
yarn lint
yarn test
yarn format

# 3. Follow architectural patterns
# Reference specs/architecture.md
```

### Code Review Process
1. **Standards Compliance:** Verify adherence to code style guidelines
2. **Security Review:** Check for security best practices
3. **Architecture Alignment:** Ensure changes fit the overall system design
4. **Documentation:** Verify that relevant documentation is updated

## Continuous Improvement

### Specification Updates

- **Development Velocity:** Monitor time from specification to deployment
- **Developer Satisfaction:** Regular surveys on specification utility
- **Security Metrics:** Track security-related issues and compliance

## Tools and Automation

### Code Quality Enforcement
```bash
# Linting and formatting
yarn lint          # Check code style
yarn lint:fix      # Auto-fix issues
yarn format        # Format code
