# AetherOS Development Best Practices

This document outlines the core principles and practices for developing high-quality, secure, and maintainable code for AetherOS.

## Development Process

*   **Git Workflow:** Trunk-based development or Feature Branching with Pull Requests.
*   **Branch Naming:** `feature/JIRA-ID-short-description`, `bugfix/JIRA-ID-short-description`, `hotfix/JIRA-ID-short-description`.
*   **Commit Messages:** Conventional Commits format (`<type>(<scope>): <description>`).
*   **Pull Requests:** Require review by at least one other developer. Use PR templates.
*   **Continuous Integration (CI):** Run linting, formatting checks, unit tests, and security scans on every PR.

## Testing Philosophy

*   **Strategy:** A balanced approach combining Unit Testing, Integration Testing, and Contract Testing. Emphasis on testing critical business logic and user flows.
*   **Unit Testing:**
    *   **Target:** Individual functions, methods, and isolated units of logic.
    *   **Framework (TS):** Jest
    *   **Framework (Python):** Pytest
    *   **Framework (Go):** Standard `testing` package
    *   **Coverage Goal:** Aim for >80% coverage on core business logic modules.
*   **Integration Testing:**
    *   **Target:** Interaction between modules, services, and external dependencies (databases, APIs).
    *   **Framework (TS):** Jest (with testcontainers or mocks) / Supertest for API endpoints.
    *   **Framework (Python):** Pytest (with pytest-docker or moto for AWS mocks).
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing (Optional for MVP):**
    *   **Target:** Critical user journeys simulating real user behavior.
    *   **Tool:** Playwright or Cypress.
*   **Test Data:** Use factories (e.g., FactoryBoy for Python, factory-girl for JS) or fixtures to manage test data cleanly.

## Performance vs Readability

*   **Default:** Prioritize readability and maintainability.
*   **Optimization:** Profile and optimize only when performance bottlenecks are identified through monitoring or load testing.
*   **Documentation:** Clearly document any intentional trade-offs made for performance reasons.

## Security Considerations

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Services and users should have only the minimum permissions necessary.
*   **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize *all* inputs (API requests, user data, file uploads) at the boundary layer.
*   **Dependency Management:** Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `govulncheck`. Automate updates where possible.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:**
    *   Implement robust authentication (OAuth 2.0/JWT) and authorization (RBAC) as per `tech-stack.md`.
    *   Never log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, PII).
*   **Secure Coding Practices:**
    *   Prevent common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10): Injection (SQL, NoSQL, command), Broken Authentication, Sensitive Data Exposure, XXE, Broken Access Control, Security Misconfiguration, XSS, Insecure Deserialization, Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities, Insufficient Logging & Monitoring.
    *   Use parameterized queries for database interactions.
    *   Implement proper Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for the frontend.
*   **Secrets Management:** Never hardcode secrets. Use environment variables and secure secret stores (Vault, cloud providers).
*   **Execution Sandboxing:** Isolate user-generated code execution in restricted environments (Docker containers with resource limits, dropped capabilities, network restrictions).

## API Design Best Practices

*   **Versioning:** Version APIs in the path (`/api/v1/...`) or via headers.
*   **RESTful Design:** Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) correctly. Use nouns for resources.
*   **Error Handling:** Return consistent error response formats (e.g., `{ "error": { "code": "NOT_FOUND", "message": "Resource not found", "details": {...} } }`). Use appropriate HTTP status codes.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse.
*   **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI). The `ai1docs.abacusai.app` consolidation effort should inform how we structure and present our *own* API documentation.

## Observability

*   **Logging:** Use structured logging (JSON format) with consistent fields (timestamp, level, service, trace_id, span_id). Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR).
*   **Metrics:** Instrument key business and system metrics (request latency, error rates, user activity). Use Prometheus format.
*   **Tracing:** Implement distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) to track requests across services.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Set up dashboards (Grafana) and alerts for critical metrics and errors.

## AI Integration Specifics

*   **Prompt Engineering:** Treat prompts as code. Version control them. Use prompt templates.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Implement mechanisms to evaluate and log the quality/relevance of AI outputs.
*   **Fallbacks:** Design fallback logic for AI service failures or poor-quality outputs.
*   **Cost Management:** Monitor and optimize LLM usage costs. Implement caching for frequent or expensive prompts where appropriate.
*   **Bias & Fairness:** Be aware of potential biases in LLM outputs and implement checks or guidelines where necessary.
*   **Rate Limiting & Retries:** Implement robust retry logic with exponential backoff for AI API calls, respecting provider-specific rate limits (as documented in `ai1docs.abacusai.app`).
