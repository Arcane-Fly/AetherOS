## üöÄ Getting Started Workflow

### For New Developers

1. **Read [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)** - Set up your environment
2. **Review [development-standards.md](./development-standards.md)** - Learn the conventions
3. **Check [build-tooling-summary.md](./build-tooling-summary.md)** - Understand current build tooling (optional)
4. **Check the main [README.md](../README.md)** - Understand the project
5. **Start coding!**

### For Code Reviews

1. Check adherence to [development-standards.md](./development-standards.md) (frontend)
2. Check adherence to [python-standards.md](./python-standards.md) (backend)
3. Verify linting passes
4. Ensure tests are included

### For Deployment

1. Review [railway-fix.md](./railway-fix.md) for Railway-specific issues
2. Run `yarn validate:railpack-advanced` before deployment
3. Verify environment variables are set
4. Check health endpoints

## üîß Tools & Configuration

### Yarn 4.9.2+
AetherOS uses Yarn 4.9.2 or higher via Corepack for package management.

```bash
# Enable and verify
corepack enable
corepack prepare yarn@4.9.2 --activate
yarn --version
```

### ESLint & Prettier
Code quality and formatting tools configured for the frontend.

```bash
# Lint code
cd frontend && yarn lint

# Format code
cd frontend && yarn format
```

### Husky
Pre-commit hooks automatically run linting before commits.

```bash
# Hooks run automatically on commit
git commit -m "Your message"
```
