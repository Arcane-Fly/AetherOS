# Build Tooling Summary for AetherOS

## Quick Decision: Stick with Yarn Workspaces ✅

**Current Setup**: Yarn 4.9.2 Workspaces  
**Status**: ✅ Optimal for current scale  
**Next Review**: When you hit trigger conditions (see below)

## Why Yarn Workspaces Now?

Your repository is perfectly sized for Yarn Workspaces:
- 6 total workspaces (frontend, 3 backend services, contracts, root)
- JavaScript/TypeScript focused (100% of current codebase)
- Small to medium team
- Simple CI/CD needs
- No multi-language complexity yet

**Bottom line**: You don't need additional build tooling complexity today.

## When to Consider Nx

Add Nx when you hit **2 or more** of these triggers:

1. ⚠️ **Scale**: More than 10 workspace packages
2. ⚠️ **Time**: CI builds consistently exceed 10 minutes
3. ⚠️ **Team**: More than 5 active developers
4. ⚠️ **Shared Code**: Frequent changes to shared libraries affecting multiple apps
5. ⚠️ **Pain**: Developers complaining about slow builds

**Migration Effort**: 1-2 days (very low risk, reversible)

## When to Consider Bazel (Rarely)

Only consider Bazel if **all** of these are true:

1. ❌ Python/native code becomes 50%+ of codebase
2. ❌ Need hermetic, reproducible builds (compliance/security)
3. ❌ Building native binaries at scale
4. ❌ Have Bazel expertise in-house

**Migration Effort**: 4-12 weeks (high risk, significant complexity)

**Recommendation for AetherOS**: ❌ Avoid unless requirements dramatically change

## Python Integration Plan

When you add Python ML services (as planned):

**Recommended Approach**: uv + optional Nx
- Use `uv` for Python package management (already in your standards)
- Keep JavaScript services with Yarn
- If using Nx: Add custom executors to orchestrate Python tasks
- **Avoid Bazel** unless Python becomes dominant

## Current Commands (Keep Using These)

```bash
# Install all dependencies
yarn install

# Run specific workspace
yarn workspace aetheros-frontend run dev
yarn workspace aetheros-auth-service run start

# Run in all workspaces
yarn workspaces foreach -pt run build
yarn workspaces foreach -pt run test

# Add dependency to workspace
yarn workspace aetheros-frontend add react-query
```

## Timeline Recommendations

### Now (2024 Q4)
✅ **Continue with Yarn 4.9.2 Workspaces**
- Focus on product features
- No tooling changes needed

### Next 3-6 Months
⏰ **Monitor trigger conditions**
- Track: # of packages, CI time, team size
- Evaluate Nx if 2+ triggers hit

### 6-12 Months
🐍 **Add Python services with uv**
- Keep separate or integrate with Nx
- Don't add Bazel complexity

### 12+ Months
🔄 **Reassess based on growth**
- If still JS-heavy: Stay with Yarn/Nx
- If Python-heavy: Consider Bazel (unlikely)

## Key Metrics to Track

Monitor these quarterly:
- [ ] Number of workspace packages
- [ ] Average CI build time
- [ ] Team size
- [ ] Developer satisfaction with build speed
- [ ] Language distribution (JS/TS vs Python)

## Questions?

### "Should we adopt Nx now to be proactive?"
**No.** Wait for trigger conditions. Premature optimization costs time without benefits.

### "What about Turborepo?"
Similar to Nx but less mature. Nx is better for TypeScript-heavy monorepos like yours.

### "Can we mix Nx and Bazel?"
Yes, but adds significant complexity. Only if absolutely necessary (very rare).

### "What about pnpm workspaces?"
pnpm is in your fallback list. Yarn 4.9.2 is already working well. No need to change.

### "Should we prepare for Bazel now?"
**No.** 99% chance you won't need Bazel. Focus on features instead.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Continue using Yarn 4.9.2 Workspaces (no action needed)
2. ⏰ Set calendar reminder for Q1 2025 to review trigger conditions
3. 📊 Start tracking metrics (packages, CI time, team size)
4. 📖 Bookmark the full documentation for when you need it
